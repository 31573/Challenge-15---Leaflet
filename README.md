USGS Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet
Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental impacts, and climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop tools and methods to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about Earth and its processes.

The USGS aims to build new visualization tools to better understand and display their earthquake data. Despite collecting massive amounts of data worldwide daily, they lack a meaningful way to visualize it. This project addresses that need by developing a visualization tool to educate the public and government organizations about Earth's seismic activity.


Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Follow these steps:

Get the Dataset: Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page to choose a dataset to visualize.
Import Data: Use the JSON representation of the chosen dataset's URL to pull in the data for visualization.
Visualize Data: Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
Data markers should reflect earthquake magnitude by size and depth by color.
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and those with greater depth should appear darker.
Popups: Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
Legend: Create a legend to provide context for the map data.
